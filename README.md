# classProjects-Java
These are all the projects I completed for my Java class my favorite is the Rock, Paper, Scissors Program (rps.java) and the most complex is probably 
the Build A Zoo Program 

For the programs in the folders they have classes in different files so it works all together (except for Arrays those were just exercises but still in seperate folder) everything else should work on its own without any other files

Thank you for your interest!
